# My Journey from 350 lbs to 26.2 Miles

## Abstract

There are years that ask questions and years that answer. - Zora Neal Hurston

On March 5th, 2019 - I was a 350 lb man, who was quickly approaching his 37th birthday. On February 20th, 2021 - I completed my first marathon, conquering both the miles and the freezing cold. The journey over those two years not only drastically changed my health and physical appearance, but also altered my understanding of thought, knowledge, work, and relationships.

Using my journey as the backdrop, I’ll share how I evolved from wanting change to accomplishing lasting growth. I’ll explain why Legos fill me with dread, how dancing kept my dream alive, why a tattoo keeps me grounded, and why ringing a bear bell in Japan is my dream. Throughout, I’ll connect my insights and anecdotes to the underlying principles and applications that will enable you to accomplish your goal, whatever the domain or difficulty.

My journey started with a hellacious ten minutes on an elliptical, what step will launch yours?
